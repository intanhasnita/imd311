This is a page of education. I had gone through for 3 phases of level in education. The first one is kindergarten school kids at Masjid Al-Halimi Kg Selarong. My kindergarten is nearby at the mosque actually. So it's more easy for us to do the religious activities and education. When I enter this kindergarten school kids, I am 6 and 7 years old. I gained a lot of knowledge during the class session that was happening. Other than that, I also had to be the leader in Nasyid Competition. I think maybe my voice is very nice for singing HAHAHAHAHAHAH. So, that's all about my story during kindergarten school. I will continue for the next journey.

So, let's continue on the next journey. During the primary school session, I have joined in to several school competitions like when I was 7 years old, I have been a dancer of kadazan dances which is in action song competition. I have learned how to dance with the partners and I know the steps of dances by joining the competition. Other than that, I also joined the Quran recite competition when I was 9, 10 and 12 years old. This is the most beautiful experience that I gained during my primary school. During this time, I have been fanatical with Quran recite competition, I always practice my voice at home and feel excited every time I joined this competition at my school and at the others school.

	And now is about my secondary school journey. I have school at Maktab Mahmud Baling. Before that, I want to spill the story how I can enter this school. Since I am 12 years old which is in primary school, I want to go to a full boarding school which is Menengan Agama Baling national school. But then, when I received my upsr result, I just got on 3A 2B only. so my teachers were telling me that I am not qualified to enter that school since I just got on 3A only. It is beacuse the term of the school just only takes the students who are got on 4-5A only. So, my parents decided to enter me at the Maktab Mahmud Baling. I went to interview first and I got pass the interview. During my secondary school, I gained a lot of things like, I need to be an independent person since I live at the hostel. I am also happy with the hostel surroundings, got to learn to religious subject, qasidah performance, sport session which is I joined the netball team and many more.
